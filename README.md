# Exploring and Implementing GraphQL

## Overview

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need, making it a powerful alternative to RESTful APIs. GraphQL can be used to streamline data fetching and improve performance by reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data. We will introduce you to GraphQL and guide you through the implementation of GraphQL in a TypeScript project.

## Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

- Write a GraphQL query to retrieve a specific characterâ€™s information using their ID.
- Create a GraphQL query to retrieve a paginated list of all characters.
- Write a GraphQL query to fetch the details of a specific episode using its ID.
- Kickstart the development of your rick and morty application using Next.js
- Query the Rick and Morty GraphQL endpoint to retrieve data about episodes.
